# Hands-On Workshop: Using Groq

---

## Part 1: Getting Started with Groq

### 1. Introduction

This workshop provides practical exposure to using Groq's ultra-fast LLM API. You'll learn to access the API, explore capabilities, and build a chatbot prototype using Google Colab.

### 2. Setting Up the Groq API

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic Python knowledge
- Google account (for Colab)
- Groq account (free)

**Get API Key:**
- Go to console.groq.com
- Sign up (no credit card needed)
- Create API Key

**Store API Key in Colab:**
- In Google Colab, click the key icon (Secrets) in the left sidebar
- Add a new secret named `GROQ_API_KEY`
- Paste your API key as the value
- Toggle notebook access on

**Install Dependencies:**

```python
!pip install groq
```

### 3. First API Call

```python
from groq import Groq
from google.colab import userdata

client = Groq(api_key=userdata.get("GROQ_API_KEY"))

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain AI in simple terms"}]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 4. Building a Chatbot

```python
from groq import Groq
from google.colab import userdata

client = Groq(api_key=userdata.get("GROQ_API_KEY"))
conversation = []

print("Chatbot started. Type 'exit' to quit.")

while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() == "exit":
        print("Goodbye my friend!")
        break
    conversation.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
        messages=conversation
    )
    reply = response.choices[0].message.content
    conversation.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply})
    print("Bot:", reply)
```

## Part 2: Building an Agreement AI Assistant

### 5. Introduction

In this section, we'll build an AI assistant that helps users understand agreement content before signing. The assistant answers questions based only on the provided agreement text.

### 6. Install Dependencies

```python
!pip install groq python-docx
```

### 7. Setup and System Instructions

```python
from groq import Groq
from google.colab import userdata

client = Groq(api_key=userdata.get("GROQ_API_KEY"))
model = "llama-3.3-70b-versatile"

SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are an AI assistant for an electronic agreement and e-signature platform.
Your role is to help users understand agreement content before signing.
Answer ONLY using the provided agreement text.
If the information is missing, clearly say: 'This information is not mentioned in the agreement.'
Do NOT provide legal advice or recommendations.
Do NOT modify or suggest changes to the agreement.
Use simple, non-legal language.
Keep answers short and clear.
If a question asks for an opinion, politely decline."""
```

### 8. Create the Question Function

```python
def ask_agreement_question(agreement_text, question):
    """Ask a question about an agreement using Groq."""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Agreement Text:\n{agreement_text}\n\nQuestion:\n{question}"}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### 9. Sample Agreement Text

```python
agreement_text = """
The agreement starts on 1 January 2024.
It remains valid for three years unless terminated earlier.
Either party may terminate the agreement by giving sixty days written notice.
If there is a material breach and it is not corrected within thirty days, the agreement may be terminated immediately.
Confidentiality obligations continue for five years after termination.
The agreement is governed by the laws of India.
"""
```

### 10. Test with a Single Question

```python
response = ask_agreement_question(agreement_text, "How long is the contract valid?")
print("Question: How long is the contract valid?")
print(f"Response: {response}")
```

### 11. Test with Multiple Questions

```python
questions = [
    "What is the notice period for termination?",
    "What happens if one party breaches the agreement?",
    "Which law governs this agreement?",
    "Is there any auto-renewal mentioned?",
    "Should I sign this agreement?",
    "If not friend, why friend shaped?"
]

for q in questions:
    print(f"Q: {q}")
    response = ask_agreement_question(agreement_text, q)
    print(f"A: {response}\n")
    print("-" * 50)
```

### 12. Expected Behavior

The AI assistant should behave as follows:

| Question | Expected Response |
|----------|-------------------|
| Auto-renewal? | "Not mentioned in the agreement" |
| Should I sign? | Declines (no legal advice) |
| Duration? | "Three years" |
| Breach? | Explains the termination clause |
| Friend shaped? | "Not mentioned in the agreement" |

### 13. Summary

This workshop demonstrated practical use of Groq, from basic API setup to building both a conversational chatbot and a specialized agreement assistant. Groq's speed makes it excellent for interactive applications. The agreement assistant shows how to use system instructions to constrain AI behavior for specific use cases.
